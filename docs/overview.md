Sports Stats Tracker / Sports Gurus - Project Overview
We are creating a Sports Stats Tracker Web Application platform that is designed to allow users, coaches, and analysts to view, filter, and visualize live sports data in real-time.

The system integrates and will pull external sports data APis and display it through a clean and responsive frontend. It will deliever up to date player and team statistcs. 
It will also allow users to search for players, look up particular teams, check standings, and provide live game updates. 

Our project team is made up of three members:
- Mintesinot Fino - Frontend (React)
- Jenna Stengel - Backend (Node.js / Express/ API integration)
- Carter Schroeder (Project Manager (Docs) , Database)

- We chose to create a web application for our project becasue we feel that will target the audience for our app the best.
- For our stack we have decided on using a React frontend, a Node.js/Express backend, and a MongoDB database. This stack is perfect becasue it will allow us to scale efficently if needed and make integrating APIs easier.
- We are keeping each part of system seperate so updates or bugs to one layer don't break other layers.

- Overall, we are creating this app to give users a central place to track sports info and data in real time. While improving our experience working with full-stack projects, APIs, etc.
